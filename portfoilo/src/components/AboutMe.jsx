            <h1 className='Heading2'>AboutMe</h1>
            <p className='Passage1'>I’m a passionate Navy Veteran trained in both full stack development and UX/UI design.<br/><br/>
              Traveling with the Navy for four years took me outside my comfort zone and gave me compassion for the state of the world.<br/>
              Through that experience, I discovered I wanted to contribute to making this world a better place.<br/><br/>
              Upon returning from the Navy, I worked in the maintenance field for several years but wasn’t fulfilled. The covid pandemic led me<br/>
              to take a leap of faith and make a major career change to finally pursue my passion. <br/><br/>
              I graduated from Wyncode’s immersive full-stack web development boot camp 
              in September 2020 with experience collaborating<br/>
               with designers/developers to complete two-week sprints, managing version control in Github,
              using HTML5 and CSS/Flexbox,<br/> Javascript, and React (including React Context, React Router DOM, asynchronous states, event handling, props, and
             functional<br/> components).<br/><br/>After graduating, I immediately enrolled in the UX/UI boot camp, where I practiced AGILE methodology,
              delivered and implemented<br/> design feedback, used IBM Design Thinking, UX Framework, Lean UX, Figma, and Adobe Creative Cloud. 
              I also experienced user<br/> testing, wireframing, prototyping, interaction design, responsive design, and refined my public speaking 
              skills by presenting a case<br/> study about Veteran suicide rates.<br/><br/>I graduated from the UX/UI boot camp in December 2020 and I’m thrilled to 
              be pursuing my passions by creating solutions to major<br/> problems, helping others, and giving back to the community with the use of technology.</p>
