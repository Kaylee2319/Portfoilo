            <p className='Passage1'>Passionate Navy Veteran In the middle of a career change.
             Worked in maintenance for serval years, While in the navy I 
             got to travel a lot and see the state of the world. After my
            time in the navy I knew I wanted to give back to the commuinty
            leaving the world a little bit better. Covid made me take a leap
            of faith in pursuing what I truly enjoy technology and helping 
            those around me. I enrolled in a wycode immersive bootcamp for 
            both full stack development and UXUI, with both of these skill sets 
            I can now pursue my passion by creating solutions to major problems 
            and giving back to the community.</p>
